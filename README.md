# Task Application
## Description
This is a desktop application designed in Java using JavaFX to manage task assignments within a team of users.<br>

## Purpose
This project came about from wanting to find a way to handle/manage task assignments when I was working as a student assistant to the Information Technology Department at school. The issue at work with task assignments was how to manage it. Task assignments were given daily, but the assignments were always verbally stated and jumped between individuals. So I wanted to create something to not only handle/manage task assignments, but also create something in order to streamline communication between members of a team.<br>

## Plans
Currently this project serves as a proof of concept and an introduction to GUI design using JavaFX. In the near future I would like to add a timeline to the application interface. Implement a user login page and add a database engine to the application. I would also like to design/implement a logger to assist with troubleshooting/debugging maybe create with a log viewer as well.

## Tools & Technology
Language: Java<br>
Environment: Eclipse<br>
Tools: Scene Builder 10<br>
